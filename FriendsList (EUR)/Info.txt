Make sure to edit the IP address to that of your console before you run the script.
For the symbols to show, run the script with "python FL_KB#.py" and press the Caps Lock key on your console's keyboard once (closing and opening the keyboard also works)
The keyboard will be restored to normal when you exit the app.
