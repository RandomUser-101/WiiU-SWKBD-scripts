# WiiU-SWKBD-scripts
My pyGecko scripts made for interfacing with the Wii U's Software Keyboard (SWKBD)

These scripts are made for editing keys on the Wii U software keyboard, otherwise known as SWKBD.
If you want to use these files, you'll need to use the older version of TCPGecko (the one on Loadiine.ovh) which involves downgrading browser files to run 5.5.1 exploits.

Don't expect a ton of things here. I'll make them when I want to make them.

You will need Python 2 or higher to use these scripts since they rely on you having a pyGecko setup.

Using the latest version of TCPgecko will NOT work for system appliets (Friends List, Miiverse, etc...)
