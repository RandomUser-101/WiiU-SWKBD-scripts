# WiiU-SWKBD-scripts
My pyGecko scripts made for interfacing with the Wii U's Software Keyboard (SWKBD).

These scripts are made for editing keys on the Wii U software keyboard, otherwise known as SWKBD.
If you want to use some of these files (the ones made for the Applets and the Mii Maker), you'll need to use the older version of TCPGecko (the one on Loadiine.ovh) which involves downgrading browser files to run 5.5.1 exploits.

Don't expect a ton of things here. I'll make them when I want to make them.

You will need Python 2 or higher to use these scripts since they rely on you having a pyGecko setup. Put these scripts in the pyGecko folder and run with `python (script).py`. Make sure to change the IP address at the top of the script to that of your console's IP address.

Using the latest version of TCPGecko will NOT work for system appliets (Friends List, Miiverse, etc...)

Mii Maker also will not work with the latest TCPGecko due to the nature of homebrew on Wii U.



Keep in mind most of these scripts will be intented for EUR/PAL versions of games/applets. I don't have access to a USA/NTSC-U or JPN/NTSC-J console. However, if you somehow port these scripts to different regions, and you would like them uploaded, hit me up (Randm#5310 on Discord or create an Issue here) and I'll add them here!
