# WiiU-SWKBD-scripts
My pyGecko scripts made for interfacing with the Wii U's Software Keyboard (SWKBD).
SWKBD codes I make here will also be in TXT form if the game or app supports loading/running it with JGecko U.

These scripts are made for editing keys on the Wii U software keyboard, otherwise known as SWKBD.
If you want to use some of these files (the ones made for the Applets), you'll need to use the older version of TCPGecko (the one on Loadiine.ovh) which involves downgrading browser files to run 5.5.1 exploits.

Don't expect a ton of things here. I'll make them when I want to make them.

You will need Python 2 or higher to use these scripts since they rely on you having a pyGecko setup. If you're using any TXT codes here, using JGecko U with the latest TCPGecko should work fine.

Using the latest version of TCPGecko will NOT work for system appliets (Friends List, Miiverse, etc...)



Keep in mind most of these scripts/codes will be intented for EUR/PAL versions of games/applets. I don't have access to a USA/NTSC-U or JPN/NTSC-J console. However, if you somehow port these scripts to different regions, and you would like them uploaded, hit me up (Randm#5310) and I'll add them here!
